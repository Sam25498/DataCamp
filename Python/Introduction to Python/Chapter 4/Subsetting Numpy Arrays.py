# height_in and weight_lb are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Store weight and height lists as numpy arrays
np_weight_lb = np.array(weight_lb)

# Print out the weight at index 50
print(np_weight_lb[50])

# Print out sub-array of np_height_in: index 100 up to and including index 110
print(np_height_in[100:111])

#output:
