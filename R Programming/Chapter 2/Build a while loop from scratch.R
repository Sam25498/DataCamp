"Finish the while loop so that it:

prints out the triple of i, so 3 * i, at each run.
is abandoned with a break if the triple of i is divisible by 8, but still prints out this triple before breaking."

# Initialize i as 1 
i <- 1

# Code the while loop
while (i <= 10) {
  print(3 * i)
  if ((3 * i)%%8 == 0) {
    break
  }
  i <- i + 1
}
