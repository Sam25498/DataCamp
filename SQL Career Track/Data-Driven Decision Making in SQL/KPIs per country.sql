KPIs per country
In chapter 1 you were asked to provide a report about the development of the company. This time you have to prepare a similar report with KPIs for each country separately. Your manager is interested in the total number of movie rentals, the average rating of all movies and the total revenue for each country since the beginning of 2019.
