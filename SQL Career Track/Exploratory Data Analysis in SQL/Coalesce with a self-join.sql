Coalesce with a self-join
You previously joined the company and fortune500 tables to find out which companies are in both tables. Now, also include companies from company that are subsidiaries of Fortune 500 companies as well.

To include subsidiaries, you will need to join company to itself to associate a subsidiary with its parent company's information. To do this self-join, use two different aliases for company.

coalesce will help you combine the two ticker columns in the result of the self-join to join to fortune500.

Instructions
